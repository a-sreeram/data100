## Reflection 1

*Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis. Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. (1) "Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences" Anna Raymond (2) "Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results." Nira Nair (3) "In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." Kayla Seggelke How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency" and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science?*

Blumenstock writes about the explosion of data science and its creation of vast promises, opportunities, and potential breakthroughs for the human race as a whole. He recognizes both the insane potential as well as the prominent concerns and pitfalls of this recent technology and makes points to validate both sides of the argument.

Blumenstock outlines many promises that data science provides us with including the collateral benefits from collecting data from the 95% of people who have mobile phone coverage. For example, it is possible to deliver credit scores to people based on machine-learning algorithms that take into account patterns based on phone calls and geographical information. These algorithms can be altered to even detect digital signatures of poverty just off personal data and satellite imagery. This myriad of information can be more easily used by the government to deliver focused humanitarian attention to people who are shown to need it the most. The digital footprints that algorithms would be able to detect can similarly also help with epidemic (or pandemic) interventional systems, to scan neighborhoods and collect geographical information on spread of disease and even impact of natural disasters. Through Blumenstock’s analysis, he demonstrates that data science has much wider applications than simply plotting out maps and doing data calculations; he understands its global impact and how data science could revolutionize worlds of foreign relations, healthcare, and other international issues.

There are four “pitfalls” that Blumenstock describes when outlining these benefits, the first being its unanticipated effects. These amount to misinformation, misappropriation, and unruly government intervention. Essentially, by making information widely available, it is easy to find those who would rather use it to put up more barriers than break down. The second issue is lack of validation, meaning that our tools may never know their limitations until it is too late. Since it is hard to test data science on a global scale through simulation or anything artificial means, it is entirely possible that it may be deployed with flaws or shortcomings that can lead to less-than-deal accuracy or harmful consequences. As the world is changing over time, with each passing second, so too do the algorithms need to adapt and overcome the evolution they observe. The question becomes whether or not they will be able to do this, and for how long. Blumenstock also acknowledges that people who gain a well-enough understanding of the data science behind this revolution can easily game it, as no human-created system is perfect, and this can lead to unintentional setbacks that may even reverse effects to a point lower than where they initially were. The third pitfall is biased algorithms, which essentially realizes that the system may favor certain wealthy countries that have better connectivity and reliability than poorer, remote ones. Less data points in third-world countries means less information. The last pitfall and potentially the most concerning is the lack of regulation associated with this technology. Unless championed by the government, this tech would be left to private companies, whose main goal is to turnover a profit rather than further humanity. With the wrong goals in mind, the algorithm and entire system itself could be put to wrong use and its data may be used for unethical purposes. Companies like Facebook and Google have come under fire for “stealing” data and selling it to advertisers and this could be an analogous story, except on a much larger scale.

With all these issues potentially wreaking global havoc, is it even safe to allow such a system to be created? Blumenstock argues that with certain strict precautions, we can do our best to ensure that the path forward is a correct and safe one. Firstly, he says to validate rather than replace data; data science should work alongside traditional methods of collection and communication rather than replace them. He also says to customize, which would allow for specialized algorithms for each specific situation rather than attempting a one-size-fits-all approach. The third way is through collaboration, where the private and public sectors team up to create such a system so that everyone’s best interests are at mind and future conflicts may be mitigated.

**"Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences."**

This is completely true. There has been a persisting question of intent vs. impact, and it’s analogous to the more-relevant (to me) concept of an “A for effort.” That’s not how the real world works. Involuntary manslaughter still gets you prison time, and throwing the world’s biosphere out of balance is a risk that we cannot be forced to take. When dealing with human lives and even the future of our species, good intent gets us next to nowhere. It has to be backed up with mounds of evidence, testing, and concrete data that shows that we are more than just “optimistic”about the outcome of a system that could reach billions of people worldwide.

**"Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results."**

Although I wouldn’t say transparency is the underlying issue, it certainly is one we can/should always work on, especially on the data-based side. The entire basis of politics being such a touchy subject is the lack of transparency, and technology tycoons like Elon Musk, who are combining the public and private sectors, keep transparency are the forefront of their projects to prevent their company from entering into political arguments and discussions. If we can separate politics from this implementation of data science (as much as reasonably possible), then transparency will be a necessary part of that.

**"In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hindrances, the balancing act can become difficult."**

Nothing on a scale this large can be easy. I’d argue that “can become difficult” is a huge understatement, but it’s also important to look at the huge potential if we spend time and care for this project, giving it the respect it indubitably deserves. I think this statement ties into the first one, because it is impossible to understate the importance of taking our time with a project of this magnitude to make sure it’s more than just a “humanitarian effort.”
